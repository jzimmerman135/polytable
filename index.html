    <h1>Proposal for a Culturally Healthy Social Media</h1>

    <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true" class="note">
      This essay was originally written for a class on the Philosophy of
      Technology. The professor graciously allowed me to alter the assignment
      from a critical analysis of social media to a design proposal for a new
      social media. I have provided mappings from concepts to the text to help
      identify where I may be implicitly referencing a class question. Hover

      <h2>Introduction, Inspiration and Design Philosophy</h2>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        In <a href="">Notes on the Synthesis of Form</a>, architect Christopher
        Alexander suggests that we must
        <span class="concept0"
          >design <strong>forms</strong> that <strong>fit</strong> their
          <strong>context</strong></span
        >. According to Alexander, good fit is extremely hard to invent or
        describe, but that by identifying <strong>misfits</strong> between the
        form and context, we can create natural designs. This proposal intends
        to systematically resolve misfits between today's cultural context and
        <strong>forms</strong> of social media, resulting in a
        <span class="concept0">
          distributed media platform whose form <em>enriches</em> it's
          context.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        Another crucial resource was Joanne K. Cheung's reflection
        <a href="">User's vs Muses</a>, which paints the 21st century as the
        "Century of the User", and questions the dynamic that users play when we
        engage with mainstream technologies today. Her reflections on how
        designers can empower users, were highly influential.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        Finally, this paper draws on the vision of Doug Engelbart — whose
        mission was to
        <span class="concept0">augment human intelligence.</span> For Doug in
        1968, it was the desire to augment human intelligence that lead him to
        invent the user interfaces and many computing features we would still
        consider advanced today. In this paper we update Doug's questioning to
        ask, can technology be used to augment a <em>culture</em>?.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <div>
          When reading the rest of this paper, it is important to remember that
          we often think of a social media as <em>successful</em> when it is
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="concept1">Visited many times per day</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="concept1"
              >Fun and digestibile enough that we use it for hours on end</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="concept1">Socially and politically powerful</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="concept1"
              >Embedded in and altering our social fabric
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="concept1"
              >Making its parent company wealthy beyond comprehension</span
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          I'd suggest though, that these qualities actually identify an
          <em><strong>un-</strong>successful</em> social media. In many respects
          this project seeks to intentionally oppose these values, so I ask that
          you try to resist skeptecism based on these metrics.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Dynamics of Engagement</h2>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        When we call an application design as a "social media", we could be
        referring to any number of forms. However, the primary thread between
        them being is always idea that the "users" create the content.
        Theoretically, this means that the creators and the consumers are the
        same people, but for the most popular social media platforms that this
        is hardly true. The most popular social medias operate more as an
        entertainment platform than a virtual community space. And they provide
        two primary roles of interacting with the platform, performers and
        witnesses.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        The performer is the person creating something to be seen and
        appreciated by an audience. Platforms vary greatly in the kinds of
        performances they encourage, long performances like Youtube, short
        performances like TikTok, social performance like Instagram, even a
        clever quips to Twitter is a form of performance. To be concrete, the
        act of creating for an audience, distinguishes performance from normal
        use. Sending a snapchat of your face is not a performance, though a snap
        story is — commenting well wishes on someones post is not a performance,
        but commenting a joke for the other viewers is.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        A performance can leave its consumers with an impression of joy,
        entertainment, bitterness, rage or jealousy. Though performance is
        inherent to creating on social media, as I mentioned earlier — it's the
        very thing that <em>is</em> social media. Therefore, it is crucial that
        we are intentional about the kinds of performances we encourage and
        obstruct when designing the form of our platform. Neil Postman's
        critical analysis of the television in
        <em>Amusing Ourselves to Death</em>, guides us that "there is a
        determinate relationship between form and content". However, a wide
        variety of performance mediums exist throughout popular social medias,
        though many of the issues remain. I propose that the aspect of
        <em>form</em> that must be revised is the dynamics of engagement as a
        user. Uplifting users to be more than witnesses. Instead it is the
        <em>context</em> of the performance, that hurts social media. It is the
        demarcation of the performer and the witness that breeds an unhealthy
        dynamic.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        The witness is a passive role, or as Cheung describes,
        <span class="concept3"
          >"reduced to two thumbs and a pair of eyes". For the unimaginable
          amount of time we spend as users, it is hard to articulate what more
          we do than merely witness. Social media platforms have caged our role
          of the user as only worthy of contributing feedback. To consume and
          judge. It is worth lamenting the agency we user give up.
        </span>
        Reflecting on the vastly mismatched amounts of authentic performance,
        within seas of judgement and consumption, it is no wonder that these
        spaces are so dysfunctional. But when our capabities as users range from
        either scrolling, liking or commenting — what more is there to do?
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        BeReal is an interesting example of forcing all users to be
        participants. They uplift the user to take part in the content, but
        still prevent anyone from making a meaningful contribution. BeReal
        encourages performaning in a medium that is "real", effortless and
        frequent, a better app would embrace the power of performance and
        encourage something meaningful and intentional.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        Before diving deeper, I want to reflect on the emotional dynamic we want
        users to experience. We want them to feel curious, inspired and capable
        of performing their own creations. We want people reaching out learn
        from each other. We want people to feel empowered. To me, this is vastly
        different than how I feel browsing other social media, amused, passive,
        and semi-conscious.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a social media of the future to ameliorate this misfit, I think we
        must re-envision the role of the user. To destroy the demarcation
        between stage and audience. To empower <em>all</em> users to engage
        exclusively by creating and contributing, and emphasize collaboration
        over individual performances. To raise everyone onto
        <strong class="concept0">a single collaborative stage</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>A Reinvisioned Stage</h2>
      <h3>Posts and Content</h3>
      <p>
        The kinds of content on this platform will be very open, though the
        interface will favor long form content that took effort to create. It
        will feature many standard kinds of social media content, such as
      </p>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Captioned photographs</li>
          <li>Videos</li>
          <li>Statements (think tweets)</li>
        </ul>
        Except it will also support other kinds of files worthy of archiving,
        such as
        <ul>
          <li>PDFs</li>
          <li>Sheet music</li>
          <li>3D files</li>
          <li>Datasets</li>
          <li>Source code</li>
          <li>Custom interactive HTML interfaces</li>
          <li>
            Thumbnail references to mediums outside the walled garden of the
            platform, like books, paintings, films and TV shows, websites
          </li>
        </ul>
        The other kinds of "posts" can be interactive and structured
        compositions of other posts. A user could post a
        <ul>
          <li>Manually curated feed</li>
          <li>Folder of posts</li>
          <li>Remixing of someone else's post</li>
          <li>Living/open document</li>
          <li>Structured and formalized debate</li>
          <li>Comment section</li>
          <li>
            Question (could have special restricitions on how people respond)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Semantically, there wouldn't be a distinction between a picture and a
          comment section, both would be posts of their own.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Links and Hypermedia</h3>
      <p>
        The platform would allow anyone to create a link to anybody else's post.
        These links would be visually equivalent to a user's own post, but
        following it would instantly take you to someone else's page. There are
        no <a href="">opaque links</a> either, a link is a thumbnail of it's
        contents, sort of like Wikipedia's link hover function — you always know
        where it is taking you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result of this is that a collection of posts will be an assemblage
        of a person's creations and inspirations. Links are the fundamental
        sharing mechanism that connects the platform.
      </p>

      <h3>Pages and Spaces</h3>
      <p>
        Profiles can create spaces, where posts will be displayed, sort of like
        a Desktop on a computer. To ease the burden of navigation, users will
        have the ability to create feeds (which are posts themselves), but users
        still retain a great deal of control over the structure and appearance
        of their space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spaces are not just owned by one person. They are often shared, and we
        could consider a variety of leadership structures for shared spaces,
        such as mods (Reddit/Discord) maybe with something like a GitHub pull
        request, to allow submissions. An important premise is to have
        everything be small and composable enough so that users can design
        combinations of posts into larger structures that fit their creative
        visions.
      </p>
      <h3>The Extension Section</h3>
      <p>
        The most signficant construct in this app is the extension section,
        which is intended to supercede the notorious comment section. Extensions
        are posts people make as a response to someone else's post. It could be
        as simple as a comment, but also could be a post as a response or
        continuation of the original author's work. Like might be found in an
        academic journal. An extension could be a link to a post on someone
        else's page, or a link to a post on your own page. Extensions are about
        making connections, they are the glue of the platform.
      </p>
      <h2>Means of Discovery</h2>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        Before we begin with designing the process of discovering new content,
        we must ask <em>why</em> we want users to see more content? Most social
        media applications have a unified reasoning — to drive engagement and
        subsequent revenue. In our platform the reasons for discovery should
        mimick those of any culture; to listen, learn and enjoy.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        While you could argue that other social media platforms are also places
        for exploring these virtues, the existing medium of discovery
        fundamentally limits how users are capable of exercising them. The
        primary medium being each of our own personalized recommendation
        systems. These algorithms that are mathematically based in the
        convergence and boxing, lead to misleading echo chambers and rabbit
        holes. Fundamentally they are often based on engagement metrics, which
        rewards shocking, misleading, extremist and divisive content.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        Finally they cripple us with an infinite stream of information —
        regardless of it's nature – our brains are not equipped to handle such
        scales of information, especially when the recommendation has been
        engineered to satisfy us. We are left with a Huxleyan craving for more
        that incapacitates our ability to meaningfully participate with social
        media in any way other than consume. Witnessing this much content
        doesn't lead to enrichment, it leads to addiction. And in a market
        driven funded by attention it is clear that these companies will do
        anything to keep us engaged.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        For techno-optimists who might look at current AI models and say "why
        can't we instead just build algorithms to encourage healthy cultural
        discourse", I ask even if it were possible to develop an algorithm that
        exclusively recommended content that truly enriches those who listen,
        learn, and enjoy it — would an infinite amount of this stuff even be
        good? Is that the best way to increase the capability of the users?
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        Instead I ask that we leverage community as a recommendation system.
        Let's use Instagram as a case study. To discover new content we can
        reliably visit the For You page with it's mystical recommendation
        sytems, or often we can see what our friends are reposting and sharing
        with us. Instagram stories is obviously not perfect, but the content we
        see in it often reflects a relatively diverse set of minds, not just our
        own. Moreover, when we do get information or misinformation through
        Instagram stories, it is accompanied by a critical piece of context —
        who posted it. Knowing why we are seeing helps ground the content.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        In the proposed social media, there will be no "the algorithm", but
        there will be a community acting as a meta-algorithm recommending,
        filtering and sharing each others performances. Although it may fall
        under some similar issues regarding the proliferation of
        attention-grabbing content, there is fundamental difference; someone
        shared it with a reason and purpose under their own inspiration. Another
        significant advantage, is that if all the content is manually curated
        and shared, there is no infinite anything. And when the scale of a
        collection overwhelms its the curator, then it will probably overwhelm
        its receiver.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        Another other means of discovery will be search, except with one twist.
        The twist is inspired by an experience I had doing archival research at
        the UC Berkeley rare records room. I was writing an essay about the 1969
        Native American occupation of Alcatraz, and I went to the Berkeley
        library to get my hands on some original photographs. I sat down at a
        table and traded with the librarian, my information about the photos for
        a pair gloves. When she returned she placed a large record box onto the
        desk. Inside it wasn't just my photos, but also personal letters,
        official records, and other resources that were invaluable to my
        project. Importantly, I never would have known to search for these
        records, it was thanks to the curationists manual work that I was able
        to access this information. Search on this platform will function
        similarly — returning manually curated collections rather than a single
        match.
      </p>
      <h2>Ranking and Ratings</h2>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        If this platform were to have any success, eventually it would have to
        grapple with the issues brought on by scale. How could a user locate a
        valuable extension in a sea of ten thousand, we need some way of
        sorting.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        Many places use likes or some other metric of mass appeal. Mass appeal
        favors familiarity and recency bias, often drowning other good ideas. To
        understand the cost of mass appeal, let's look at the fall of local news
        media in favor of national news stations. Mass appeal is why the main
        sources for news tell us nothing relevant about our lives, rather
        entertaining us with distant, marginally applicable information, while
        important local changes go unnoticed. Mass appeal serves only to
        cyclically make famous thoughts and thinkers more well-known. It sounds
        somewhat wrong but democracy may not suit internet.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        On Youtube on the other hand, the comment promotion algorithm certainly
        uses likes, but takes into account other details as well. Based purely
        on speculation, I have noticed that positive comments are often ranked
        higher than angry or negative comments. This neglects the nuances
        regarding the context why this feeling is being had, possibly
        subjugating forms of dissent. Leveraging AI tools we could theoretically
        filter for content based on an emotional response, but it is hard to
        choose emotions to prioritize without excluding other valuable ways of
        repsonding.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        Instead, we focus on demotion. And I believe there is one kind of
        response we want explicitly to demote — shallowness. This will
        conversely highlight extensions and performances that are considerate
        and thoughtful. To do this a combination of metrics would be used — one
        of which being to look at follow ups. If people extend a performance
        with curiosity and consideration, then we can assume the original
        performance was likely valuable. Similarly we will look for reflection
        as a response. While it may seem weird to prioritize these two actions
        that don't really feel natural to social media, once a status quo is
        understood that extending other's work with curiosity and reflection, it
        will feel natural. It is the design decisions beneath this algorithm
        that will set the status quo.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        The final thing that the ranking algorithm will promote is connections.
        Interesting and unique connections will be greatly rewarded —
        simultaneously fighting convergence and echo chambers, while adding a
        fundamental medium of discovery that exceeds the power of search and
        immediate community.
      </p>

      <h3>Why is any of this good?</h3>

      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        This project seeks to implement and extend Martha Nussbaum's ethical
        framework of morality as capabilities. Although, through the internet
        today, anyone is <em>technincally</em>
        capable of significantly more than ever before, the malicious practices
        of large technology corporations significantly influence what people are
        <em>actually</em> capable of. Tristan Harris shares, our thoughts and
        actions are not as independent as we may think. By demanding attention
        and reducing users to mindless consumers, these companies don't
        necessarily control what we are capable of, but rather what we
        <strong>do</strong>.
      </p>

      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        The power of this application isn't in the features it has, but in the
        culture it creates. By combining a culture of creating, with wide user
        capabilities, this application inspires people to actually
