    <h1>Proposal for a Culturally Healthy Social Media</h1>
    <h3 contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">By Jacob Zimmerman</h3>
    <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true" class="note">
      This essay was originally written for a class on Philosophy of Technology.
      The professor graciously allowed me to alter the assignment from a
      critical analysis of social media to a design proposal for a new social
      media. I have provided mappings from concepts to the text to help identify
      where I may be implicitly referencing a class question. Hover over the
      text or concepts to reveal the mappings.

      <h2>Introduction, Inspiration and Design Philosophy</h2>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        In <a href="">Notes on the Synthesis of Form</a>, architect Christopher
        Alexander suggests that we must
        <span class="concept0"
          >design <strong>forms</strong> that <strong>fit</strong> their
          <strong>context</strong></span
        >. According to Alexander, good fit is extremely hard to invent or
        describe, but that by identifying <strong>misfits</strong> between the
        form and context, we can create natural designs. This proposal intends
        to systematically resolve misfits between today's cultural context and
        <strong>forms</strong> of social media, resulting in a
        <span class="concept0">
          distributed media platform whose form <em>enriches</em> it's
          context.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        Another crucial resource was Joanne K. Cheung's reflection
        <a href="">User's vs Muses</a>, which paints the 21st century as the
        "Century of the User", and questions the dynamic that users play when we
        engage with mainstream technologies today. Her reflections on how
        designers can empower users, were highly influential.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        Finally, this paper draws on the vision of Doug Engelbart â€” whose
        mission was to
        <span class="concept0">augment human intelligence.</span> For Doug in
        1968, it was the desire to augment human intelligence that lead him to
        invent the user interfaces and many computing features we would still
        consider advanced today. In this paper we update Doug's questioning to
        ask, can technology be used to augment a <em>culture</em>?.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <div>
          When reading the rest of this paper, it is important to remember that
          we often think of a social media as <em>successful</em> when it is
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="concept1">Visited many times per day</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="concept1"
              >Fun and digestibile enough that we use it for hours on end</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="concept1">Socially and politically powerful</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="concept1"
              >Embedded in and altering our social fabric
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="concept1"
              >Making its parent company wealthy beyond comprehension</span
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          I'd suggest though, that these qualities actually identify an
          <em><strong>un-</strong>successful</em> social media. In many respects
          this project seeks to intentionally oppose these values, so I ask that
          you try to resist skeptecism based on these metrics.
        </div>

      <h2>Dynamics of Engagement</h2>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        When we call an application design as a "social media", we could be
        referring to any number of forms. However, the primary thread between
        them being is always idea that the "users" (human or corporate) create
        the content. Theoretically this means that the creators and the
        consumers are the same people, but for the most popular social media
        platforms that this is hardly true. The most popular social medias
        operate more as an entertainment platform than a virtual community
        space. When we view these platforms as a stage, the dynamics of how we
        engage with social media, are as performers or
        <span class="concept3">witnesses</span>.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        Platforms vary greatly in the kinds of performances they encourage, long
        performances like Youtube, short performances like TikTok, social
        performance like Instagram. Even platforms like Twitter where there
        theoretically isn't a difference in the mechanisms performance and
        witnessing, the platform still encourages a dynamic where few popular
        users will perform clever quips to be witnessed by the majority of other
        users. As long as there is a concept of posting, I don't think it is
        possible to avoid performances.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        BeReal tried to fight against inauthentic social performance, but when
        "BeReal time" arrived at an uninspiring moment, people had the option to
        either share a bland, meaningless photograph or, more favorably, wait to
        take their BeReal for a performance they felt happier sharing. On the
        other hand, when BeReal caught you at a good moment, and you got
        authentically perform something that made you happy, that joy inspired
        you to keep using the app. I'd argue it was fundamental to BeReals
        growth. Importanly though, both cases the "fake" BeReal and the
        coincidentally "good" BeReal are in different ways misleading.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        While misleading performances may be bad, performance itself isn't.
        Instead it is the <em>context</em> of the performance, that hurts social
        media. It is the demarcation of the performer and the witness that
        breeds an unhealthy dynamic.
      </p>
      <p contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true">
        The witness is a passive role, or as Cheung describes,
        <span class="concept3"
          >"reduced to two thumbs and a pair of eyes". It is worth lamenting the
          agency the user has given up. For the unimaginable amount of time we
          spend as users, it is hard to articulate what more we do than merely
          witness. Social media platforms have caged our role of the user as
          only worthy of contributing feedback. To consume and judge.</span
        >
        Reflecting on the vastly mismatched amounts of authentic performance,
        within seas of judgement and consumption, it is no wonder that these
        spaces are so dysfunctional.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a social media of the future to ameliorate this misfit, I think we
        must re-envision the role of the user. To destroy the demarcation
        between stage and audience. To empower <em>all</em> users to engage
        exclusively by creating and contributing, and emphasize collaboration
        over individual performances. To raise everyone onto
        <strong class="concept0">a single collaborative stage</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>A Reinvisioned Stage</h2>
      <h3>Posts and Content</h3>
      <p>
        The kinds of content on this platform will be very open, though the
        interface will favor long form content that took effort to create. It
        will feature many standard kinds of social media content, such as
      </p>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Captioned photographs</li>
          <li>Videos</li>
          <li>Statements (think tweets)</li>
        </ul>
        Except it will also support other kinds of files worthy of archiving,
        such as
        <ul>
          <li>PDFs</li>
          <li>Sheet music</li>
          <li>3D files</li>
          <li>Datasets</li>
          <li>Source code</li>
          <li>Custom interactive HTML interfaces</li>
          <li>
            Thumbnail references to mediums outside the walled garden of the
            platform, like books, paintings, films and TV shows, websites
          </li>
        </ul>
        The other kinds of "posts" can be interactive and structured. A user
        could post a
        <ul>
          <li>Manually curated feed</li>
          <li>Folder of posts</li>
          <li>Remixing of someone else's post</li>
          <li>Living/open document</li>
          <li>Structured and formalized debate</li>
          <li>Comment section</li>
          <li>
            Question (could have special restricitions on how people respond)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Semantically, there wouldn't be a distinction between a picture and a
          comment section, both would be posts of their own.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Links and Hypermedia</h3>
      <p>
        The platform would allow anyone to create a link to anybody else's post.
        These links would be visually equivalent to a user's own post, but
        following it would instantly take you to someone else's page. There are
        no <a href="">opaque links</a> either, a link is a thumbnail of it's
        contents, sort of like Wikipedia's link hover function â€” you always know
        where it is taking you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result of this is that a collection of posts will be an assemblage
        of a person's creations and inspirations. Links are the fundamental
        sharing mechanism that connects the platform.
      </p>
      <h3>Pages and Spaces</h3>
      <p>
        Profiles can create spaces, where posts will be displayed, sort of like
        a Desktop on a computer. To ease the burden of navigation, users will
        have the ability to create feeds (which are posts themselves), but users
        still retain a great deal of control over the structure and appearance
        of their space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spaces are not just owned by one person. They are often shared, and we
        could consider a variety of leadership structures for shared spaces,
        such as mods (Reddit/Discord) maybe with something like a GitHub pull
        request, to allow submissions. An important premise is to have
        everything be small and composable enough so that users can design
        combinations of posts into larger structures that fit their creative
        visions.
      </p>
      <h3>The Extension Section</h3>
      <p>
        The most signficant construct in this app is the extension section,
        which is intended to supercede the notorious comment section. Extensions
        are posts people make as a response to someone else's post. It could be
        as simple as a comment, but also could be a post as a response or
        continuation of the original author's work. Like might be found in an
        academic journal. An extension could be a link to a post on someone
        else's page, or a link to a post on your own page. Extensions are about
        making connections, they are the glue of the platform.
